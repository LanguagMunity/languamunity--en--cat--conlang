Language of the cat-people who are featured in Cannonville Heroes

Though, through the use of training-band technology, the cat-people featured
in _[Cannonville Heroes](http://cannonvilleheroes.com)_ are capable of learning
any spoken language of the cromagnids (the species of humans found on various
planets, among them Earth) and even attaining perfect fluency and accent-free
speech - enough has been revealed about their back-story to make it clear
that none of the cormagnid languages (and as a matter of fact, none of the
human languages at all) are their native language.

The name of this species of cat-people has not been revealed - in part
due to the fact that more of their language needs to be constructed
before their name is finalized.

## Conlanging Approach
The approach I am taking to constructing this language is to
devise a small bit of the language and learn it well - then devise
a bit more and learn that well - rinse, and repeat.
I figure that, if it is done this way, the language of these
cat-people is a bit more likely to have nuances appropriate
to a natural-language.
After all - though it is a conlang in our real-live universe,
in the in-story universe of _Cannonville Heroes_, it is a natlang.

It is for this reason that the primary resource of this
language is a module for LanguaMunity - a program that
is designed for the teaching of languages, not for the
construction of languages.
